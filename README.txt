A simple remake of reddit as an example project for those who would like to know more about building a front-end and a back-end using Typescript. 

Some of the frameworks and libs used on the front-end
Reactjs
Nextjs/Chakra-ui
Urql
Formik

Technologies used on the back end:
Nodejs
Express
Graphql
Databases - Postgresql and Redis (Redis is mostly used to track sessions and login tokens. The actual data is stored in Postgresql)

Users can login/register on the frontend; create, view, update and delete posts. 
Additionally, they can upvote or downvote individual posts as you can on reddit.

This project is just for demonstration and educational purposes. Take care if you wish to use it in production.

Thanks. Have a pleasant day.
